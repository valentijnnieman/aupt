# Audio Programming Template
## Description
This is a template project that I use whenever I want to quickly start up a new audio project. It includes rtmidi, fftw, libsndfile, and portaudio libraries to get up and running quickly.

## Running on Linux
- install ALSA devkit: `sudo apt-get install libasound-dev`
- make `build` dir, cd into it, and run `cmake ..`
- run `make` to build program
